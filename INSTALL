Currently I haven't got a completely automatic way of installing the
schemas into the database of choice. The basic idea is to generate as
generic SQL as I can from the XML DDL in the XML directory. The SQL is
generated to the sql directory.

I've got a quick-and-dirty python script in the bin directory that
will regenerate the SQL from the XML. I've only tested the generated
SQL with the MySQL and Sqlite3 databases so far. Currently the SQL
output works with Sqlite, but if you change the "autoincrement"
statement near the top of the python script, it will generate output
for MySQL.

There are some shell scripts in the bin directory for rebuilding the
Sqlite database or MySQL database from the SQL statements.
